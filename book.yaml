glossary:
  "amplitude": "the greatest height of a wave above its undisturbed level"
  "period": "the time for one complete oscillation of a pendulum, one complete vibration or the passage of one complete wave"
  "sound wave": "a wave that carries sound from place to place"
  "wave speed": "the speed at which a wave travels"
  "wavefront": "a line joining adjacent points on a curve that are all in step with each other"
  "wavelength": "the distance between adjacent crests (or troughs) of a wave"
  "velocity": "the speed of the object in a stated direction"
  "frequency": "the number of vibrations per second, or the number of waves per second passing a point"
  "doppler effect": "the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer who is moving relative to the wave source"
  "interference": "a phenomenon in which two waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same amplitude"
  "constructive interference": "the situation that the resultant amplitude is maximum, when the phase difference between the waves is an even multiple of π"
  "destructive interference": "the situation that the resultant amplitude is minimum (usually 0), when the phase difference between the waves is an odd multiple of π"
  "phase": "the position of a point in time (an instant) on a waveform cycle"
  "phase+difference": "the difference, expressed in degrees or time, between two waves having the same frequency and referenced to the same point in time"
  "phase comparision": "a comparison of the phase of two waveforms, usually of the same nominal frequency."
  "phase shift": "any change that occurs in the phase of one quantity, or in the phase difference between two or more quantities"
